# Dinner Menu Recommender

## Overview

This is a simple web application that recommends dinner menus. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a modern, responsive, and visually appealing design. The application generates menu recommendations with placeholder food images.

## Detailed Outline: Features and Design

*   **Dinner Menu Recommendation**:
    *   Displays a recommended dinner dish with a brief description.
    *   Presents a relevant placeholder image for the recommended dish.
    *   A "Get New Recommendation" button to fetch a new random menu.
*   **Modern and Responsive UI**:
    *   Clean and intuitive design suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
    *   Visually balanced layout with modern typography and appealing color schemes.
    *   Subtle visual effects (e.g., card shadows, hover effects) to enhance user experience.

## Current Plan

*   **`blueprint.md`**: Update this file with the current project overview, detailed features, and the plan for implementation.
*   **`index.html`**: Create the basic HTML structure for the dinner menu recommendation site, including a title, a display area for the menu (dish name, description, image), and a button to get a new recommendation.
*   **`style.css`**: Style the new HTML elements to create a modern, responsive, and visually appealing design. This will include layout, typography, colors, and responsive adjustments.
*   **`main.js`**: Implement the core JavaScript logic. This involves defining a list of dinner menus, randomly selecting one, dynamically updating the HTML content with the selected menu and a placeholder image (using an external service like Picsum Photos), and adding an event listener to the recommendation button.
